                    <p>Focusing on providing healthy and safe janitorial services, ISA CLEAN'S comprehensive green-clean initiative
                        helps reduce contaminants that harm the earth and promote sustainability. Our environmentally friendly
                        and responsible approach focuses on the proper training and use of green, chemical-free cleaning
                        solutions as well as proper disposal of any harsh detergents/cleaning compounds. ISA CLEAN’S environmentally
                        conscious cleaning approach highlights the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Environmentally safe cleaning solutions: we use only environmentally friendly products that promote
                            reusability, eco-friendly packaging and natural materials, most of which have earned the independent
                            Green Seal of approval.</li>
                        <li>Microfiber systems: our microfiber mops and clothes allow us to remove more than 99 percent of dirt,
                            dust and germs using fewer products.</li>
                        <li>Multi-filtration (HEPA/ULPA) vacuums: all our vacuums receive approval through the Carpet &amp; Rug
                            Institute’s Green Label program, leaving three times fewer particles in the air in comparison
                            to other cleaning services.</li>
                        <li>Specialized chemical dispensing systems: in order to reduce the impact of our non-toxic products,
                            we train our cleaning staff in the proper use of our green cleaning solution, making sure they
                            use the exact right amount.</li>
                        <li>Floor matting: in every Green Building, recycled floor mats are the first line of defense in preventing
                            contaminants from getting into the building.</li>
                    </ul>
